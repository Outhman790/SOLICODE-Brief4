# SOLICODE-Brief4



Project Name:

Solicode JavaScript Workshop

Project Context:

Web development is based on three pillars: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. JavaScript, due to its dynamism, versatility, flexibility, popularity, and accessibility, is among the most sought-after web languages in the job market. To help you get started with JavaScript, we propose the development of a responsive educational website that allows you to master the basics of structured programming and web development using JavaScript through various exercises provided in the attachments.

The application will consist of a left-side menu (with sub-menus) and a main block divided into three sections: one for the exercise statement, a second to simulate the solution, and a third to write the JavaScript script. The menu covers the following chapters:

    Variables and Assignments
    Conditions
    Loops
        The "for" loop
        The "while" loop
        Nested loops
    Strings
        Search and removal
        Counting vowels
    Arrays
        Sorting
        Searching
    Functions
